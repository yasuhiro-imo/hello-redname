This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Discription

It's a very simple React-App for react-beginner-developers.

It displays words in red when you type them in the text-box.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
